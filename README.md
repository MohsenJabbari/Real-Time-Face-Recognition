# Real-Time-Face-Recognition
My apologies, here is a new description within the 330-character limit.  This is a real-time face recognition system using machine learning. It employs a Tkinter GUI for a user-friendly experience and OpenCV to detect faces from a webcam. The core model is a scikit-learn SVM that uses HOG and LBP features to identify people from a custom dataset.
